                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>A neutron star consists of a hyper-dense sphere of neutrons, divided into a solidified surface layer and a less solid layer beneath. Its structure is supported against gravity by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, as gravitational compression forces additional certainty in the position of the neutrons and thereby increases the uncertainty in their velocity. This creates pressure and an outward force capable of supporting the neutron star's structure against its own gravity.</p>

            <div id="formation">
                <h2>Neutron star formation</h2>
                <p>As a type of stellar remnant, neutron stars form after the death of a star that is too massive to form a dwarf star and not massive enough to form a black hole. The star dies following the depletion of its hydrogen and helium fuel source, contracting suddenly and exploding outwards in a supernova, leaving only its hyper-dense core behind. The matter in this core is compressed by gravity to the point of fusing its atoms' electrons and protons until only neutrons remain. Following this, there can be additional shocks to the neutron star as its surface is strained to breaking and is immediately forced down by gravity.</p>

            <div id="pulsars">
                <h2>Pulsars</h2>
                <p>Pulsars are a type of active stellar remnant that retains the angular momentum of its previous stellar form and as a result rotates at great speed. Pulsars become active when they accrete additional matter onto themselves, whether from orbiting objects or from interstellar gas clouds. This material drops precipitously quickly onto the neutron star's surface, and the impact produces a tremendous burst of energy. In addition, neutron stars emit highly powerful magnetic fields, and combined with rotation, a pulsar appears to change in brightness on a regular interval.</p>
