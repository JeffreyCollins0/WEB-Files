            <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>A neutron star consists of a hyper-dense sphere of neutrons, divided into a solidified surface layer and a less solid layer beneath. </p>
                <p>Its structure is supported against gravity by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, as gravitational compression forces additional certainty </p>
                <p>in the position of the neutrons and thereby increases the uncertainty in their velocity. This creates pressure and an outward force </p>
                <p>capable of supporting the neutron star's structure against its own gravity.</p>

            <h2>Neutron star formation</h2>
                <p>As a type of stellar remnant, neutron stars form after the death of a star that is too massive to form a dwarf star and not massive </p>
                <p>enough to form a black hole. The star dies following the depletion of its hydrogen and helium fuel source, contracting suddenly and </p>
                <p>exploding outwards in a supernova, leaving only its hyper-dense core behind. The matter in this core is compressed by gravity to the </p>
                <p>point of fusing its atoms' electrons and protons until only neutrons remain. Following this, there can be additional shocks to the </p>
                <p>neutron star as its surface is strained to breaking and is immediately forced down by gravity.</p>

        <section id="pulsars">
            <h2>Pulsars</h2>
                <p>Pulsars are a type of active stellar remnant that retains the angular momentum of its previous stellar form and as a result rotates </p>
                <p>at great speed. Pulsars become active when they accrete additional matter onto themselves, whether from orbiting objects or from </p>
                <p>interstellar gas clouds. This material drops precipitously quickly onto the neutron star's surface, and the impact produces a </p>
                <p>tremendous burst of energy. In addition, neutron stars emit highly powerful magnetic fields, and combined with rotation, a pulsar </p>
                <p>appears to change in brightness on a regular interval.</p>
